# Machine Learning
This repository contains the coursework that I have done for the course Machine Learning by Stanford University with professor Andrew Ng, re-done using the Python ML libraries (I will be using Scikit-Learn throughout the code base).

The main purpose of this repository is for bettering my own understanding of Machine Learning practices, as well as re-applying what I've learning using one of the most popular machine learning libraries in the industry.

I will be creating a detailed description of the coursework in the readme section of each assignment. If you are currently enrolled in the course, I highly recommend that you do not look at the code; instead, feel free to look through my overview to hopefully better your understanding of what you are learning.

Things I will be doing for each assignment:
<ul>
  <li>Re-doing the assignments using Python as oppose to Octave</li>
  <li>Finding the best fitting model for each data set</li>
  <li>Overviewing my findings for each assignment</li>
</ul>
